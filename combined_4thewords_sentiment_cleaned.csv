YouTube,"I feel like $40 for a 1-year subscription isn&#39;t that bad for what they offered. Now they use a more general subscription service that will cost you $96(members) or $144 (pro), otherwise if you do monthly its $10 ($120pa) and $14 ($168pa). The module they used before was more versatile in that you just paid when you wanted and didn&#39;t need to &quot;Unsubscribe&quot; which a lot of people forget to do.  Paying the $40 was the cheapest, you get what are essentially 16 bonus crystals.<br>I just use the free version, I like the challenge of only being able to have 15 battles/4 quests per-day as it paces me so I&#39;m not spending all of my time, I have to use it effectively.

\- Coffeequills (co-op always on, switches between public/private)

\- KeryWrites (we've join lobbies sometimes!) :)

Too frequently, I think artists burn themselves out regardless of their medium in a desperate attempt to keep consistent. Forcing ourselves to forego something else we enjoy (like watching a show, seeing friends, etc.) in order to sit down and strive for a creative epiphany often leads to a dislike for our craft.
Negative reinforcement (removing a positive object or activity to encourage the continuation of a behavior; think taking a kid’s phone away to encourage completing homework) tends to give people a negative relationship with their work or hobbies. That’s not to say self-discipline isn’t necessary or inherently bad, but if you find yourself cutting out other positive aspect of your life to focus purely on something you’re supposed to ENJOY doing, maybe reflect on your working process.",2024-10-29,community,0.069,0.205,0.971,positive

Reddit,"This reminds me of a study I read about in Paul Silvia's book How to Write a Lot. 

From research by Robert Boice (1990):

""He gathered a sample of college professors who struggled with writing, and he randomly assigned them to use different writing strategies. People in an abstinence condition were forbidden from all nonemergency writing; people in a spontaneous condition scheduled 50 writing sessions but wrote only when they felt inspired; and people in a contingency management condition scheduled 50 writing sessions and were forced to write during each session. (They had ro send a check to a disliked organization if they didn't do their writing.) The dependent variables were the number of pages written per day and the number of creative ideas per day...First, people in the contingency management condition wrote a lot: They wrote 3.5 times as many pages as people in the spontaneous condition and 16 times as much as those in the abstinence condition. People who wrote ""when they felt like it"" were barely more productive than people told not to write at all. Inspiration is overrated. Second, forcing people to write enhanced their creative ideas for writing. The typical number of days between creative ideas was merely 1 day for people who were forced to write; it was 2 days for people in the spontaneous condition and 5 days for people in the abstinence condition. Writing breeds good ideas for writing"" (Silvia 2007, p. 24). 

If anyone is interested, the first edition of Silvia's book is available as a pdf: [https://books-library.net/files/books-library.online-02282155Al7A1.pdf](https://books-library.net/files/books-library.online-02282155Al7A1.pdf)

Reddit,"Hello! I came across your post a while ago and saved it but never got around to following up—hope it’s not too late! I wanted to ask if you have any advice for motivating writers to stay active and engaged in a community.

I run a Spanish writers' group on Discord with over 400 members, and while we organize monthly events to encourage participation, only a few people join. For example, we recently created a poll about hosting a writing event similar to ""Inktober,"" and 9–11 people initially expressed interest. However, only 4–5 participated during the first week, and by the end of the month, there were just 2. This happens often, and my team and I are unsure how to improve engagement or motivate members to participate in events and focus on their own stories.

Thanks so much for your time! I'd love to chat more with you privately about this and, if possible, learn more about your website.

Reddit,"I'd like to throw in for 4thewords and also give a shout-out to London Writers' Salon.

[London Writers' Salon](http://londonwriterssalon.com) (LWS) is a group that meets on Zoom almost every day. There's a brief motivation/introduction period and then the next 50 minutes are spent writing in silence. Everyone, all these writers, are basically committed to uphold an honor code and write 'together' on their own projects. It's motivation and a promise to do it. LWS has a fee to join, but there's a free option for broke people like me.

If you're interested in [4thewords](https://4thewords.com), I think my buddy code might get us both benefits, but I'm not sure as I've never used it. (Edit: just checked and we do indeed each get a reward. My referral code is GYFUS23394 if you're interested.)

NaNoWriMo (reading about other people doing it and how it transformed their whole writing process, outlook, and outcome, essentially) is what gave me the push I needed to start writing regularly and with a significant daily word count.

4thewords is what got that word count to be between 1,000 - 3,500 on an average day. Any day. Every day. I never miss a day. I've been using it since November, and I've written over 356,000 words on it so far. Granted, I also use [DayOne Journal app](https://dayoneapp.com) (iOS, Android, and Web), and I copy over everything I write there into a daily journal entry on 4tw to get credit for it, but that still counts!

The way your work is set up in 4thewords, you have Projects, and then within those Projects, you have Files, all with unique names. The Projects can have a photo to represent each one in the list (so they look a bit like book covers) and a description as well. You can set a goal per project, and on the main project page, you can see the total word count for that Project, as well as the amount of time you've spent writing in it, the number of Files you have in it, its status (Private or available for others to read), and you can also view and manage the named Sections (kind of like chapters).

4thewords is a super small company, but they have near-constant events that keep me very motivated. One of the reasons I stay so motivated is that they have a small daily ""required"" word count of 444 words, but if you want to collect all the shiny stuff to deck out your characters, you have to defeat a certain number of enemies to complete quests. Those quests are yours to choose and change based on your location in the 'game' and whether or not there are events going on.

Speaking of pretty collectible items, you get rewarded with cosmetic wings you can equip based on the amount of time you have uninterrupted writing streaks. (I'm at 192 days.) Don't fret too much about missing a day here or there, or just missing the midnight deadline, though, because you can 'fix' it with Stempos, a currency you can earn by progressing and questing.

There's a great community, with forums full of supporting people. And there are even fashion competitions for your characters and decorated rooms. Oh, and there are multiplayer boss monsters, too. I've never fought one just because I'm antisocial and don't know what to do, but it's an option that is supposed to help with motivation because you don't want to let down your teammates.

Reddit,"Many of these things have already been said, but here's a list of different things I've tried, had suggested to me, or seen other writers recommend. 

Change the music you listen to, and if you don't listen to music when writing turn some on

Write something else in the same universe. It's related but not what you're emotionally invested in so it tends to be easier. I like to use it to get to know characters better, flesh out worldbuilding, or test out an idea I'm not sold on (trust me, this will help you later).

Read something. Something in a different genre, with a different voice, and a different style than what you write. That can evolve your own writing and help to avoid copying ideas straight across without realizing

Watch a movie or TV show you like. Palat cleanser, or however you spell that. 

Do something you enjoy that isn't related to writing but is still creative. You keep your artist brain artisting, but get a breath of fresh air. Similarly, you can do something you find inspiring like taking a walk or going to a museum or whatever it might be.

Write anyway. I'm guessing it's your first run-through of the novel, first draft. That means it doesn't matter if it's perfect or even good yet. It's where you get the idea out. You can fix it later.

Skip ahead. Who says you have to write the story from beginning to end? A lot of people jump around then fill in the spaces. If you aren't motivated to write where you're at, but have an idea for later in the story that you're excited about, write that! 

Open a fresh document and start over, without looking at the old one. I used to think this was extreme until I tried it and it worked. I'm still mad about it.

Change POV. It forces you to look at it through different eyes. So if it's a 3rd person pov, change to 1st person. Change the character you're writing from if it's 1st person, or change to 3rd person.

Imagine a friend has asked you to tell them your story, but they have to go in fifteen minutes. Write down what you would tell them. You can always add detail later.

Eat something, drink some water, take a nap. Sometimes writers block comes from prioritizing the story over your well being. Stop that if it applies to you.

This one is what usually works for me, but I've had friends tell me it doesn't work for them. Change something 3-10 pages back that either bothers you or you don't love as much as the rest. For example, MC goes out with the love interest and they get drinks (which leads to other things because alcohol) gets changed to they go out and get coffee instead. Butterfly effect the story.

Start writing without looking at the screen. I don't know what actual difference it makes, but sometimes it's the weird stuff that does the trick. This is another one I'm mad about.

If you are of legal age and do not have any personal issues with it, get drunk and write. DO NOT MAKE THIS YOUR GO-TO SOLUTION, IT'S HOW MANY ALCOHOLIC WRITERS BECAME ALCOHOLIC. Hence I put this last.",2024-12-16,"motivation, community",0.061,0.14,0.995,positive

Reddit,"Hello! I've noticed that most of the comments on here are all about meds and what can push away that ADHD/ADD crap. There's barely any comments on what to do around that unfortunately. I was hoping for some note taking myself.

I have ADHD and I find myself doing the exact same thing, but I have found ways(without meds, never been on them in my life), to work around it, as well as have gotten some great advice.

For one, I use laptop and phone mainly but that's not where I start. To get a different feel, I have notebooks dedicated to each 'major' story, while I have a notebook dedicated to just plain ideas. Mind you, ideas can be just a sentance or a title, or a full blown ten page thing, it's up to you. I find that writing my ideas down helps a bit, though not a lot sadly as my mind runs too fast to catch up to write everything I want, which I can see you having a problem with as well.

Anyway, once I get ideas out and form notebooks around the book idea I have, I jump to my computer and go on Google docs and start typing away all the info I made(again, mind you, you do not have to stay with writing it to notebooks before writing it on your electronic device. I, honestly, do it simultaneously as I find it more relieving to flesh out the little ideas about the book idea I had. Instant gratification, if you will.)

But still, you may wonder, what about the constant hopping between books? Well, I have a way that helps me, and hopefully, it will be of help to you too. What I do is I figure out what my main is. What book do I feel like writing out all the way, can already think of an ending, multiple scenes, the beginning, mid-life crisis for Mc, all that stuff. That book will be your main. Make sure to have goals set(I.e. How many chapters you want to reach, how many words, character development, ect..)

Then, once you fall out of that drive and feel unmotivated from continuing that book, you create your backup mains.(you don't have to wait til you loose drive before creating them, by the way.)The way I do it is I have one main book I work on, but so that I don't get writers block and/or lose interest and just end up hating what I wrote, I flip between 2-3 books. One main, and two back burners. It also helps when I try and incorporate ""fanfiction"" into my daydreaming or random spurt writings about the characters in my main trio of books I write. Like, say, MC of main book somehow finds herself in the world of second burner book and has to somehow survive it or something crazy like that. Make it fun, invite your characters to play games and funfair scenes.

Another thing that helps a bunch is mood. What's the mood of your environment. Changing clothes, taking a bath, cleaning up your area, or even dimming the lights and setting candles around you for light.(I do this as it is quite peaceful, no electronics on, outside of your computer/phone(though it ain't good for your eyes sadly)) That all contributes to making a book and putting the story you have in writing.

One more thing to note is that this may not work for you. I am just telling you what has worked for me and I still have times where I want nothing to do with the trio of books I have. I usually take a step back and enjoy other hobbies(like watching movies, yt, reading manga, or jogging) before I dive back into it again and try and reconnect with the story. It's hard, yes, but once you do and make even a bit of progress, it's so invigorating. It makes you(me anyway), feel like, ""okay, I can do this"". Just don't give up!

Anyway, I hope this helps some!",2022-11-22,none,0.052,0.167,0.9981,positive

Reddit,"I have adhd and used to struggle with this. It’s a blessing and curse, but I’d rather have too many ideas than no ideas. 

I broke out of this cycle by forcing myself to finish what I start. I literally write at the top of every document “finish the damn thing”. The draft can be badly written, rushed, all over the place; but it doesn’t matter as long as it’s finished. 

Whenever a newer, sexier idea comes to mind, I jot it down in my idea book and set it aside. I tell myself to trust that if the idea really is worth my time, it’ll be waiting for me when I finish. The new shiny idea becomes motivation to finish my current draft, because I can’t work on anything else until I finish.

That is not compatible with being a writer for trade, though. A story can take quite a while to finish like this. I do it out of passion and have a day job to pay my bills. 

Over the course of the last decade or so I have started about 9 different stories in different mediums - one is a screenplay, three are video games, one is accomic book, the rest are regular books. It can be as chaotic as it sounds.
It took me a while to start getting somewhere with any of them, but what I did was just let myself work on the one I felt most inspired by at the moment. I have successfully finished the script for one of the games and am currently working on getting funding for it. I have also finished the storyboard of the comic book, all I need is to draw it properly and color it.

Sometimes the medium of the story also came with certain limitations that led to it being stuck - for example, I have only written the overall plot for the screenplay because actually shooting a movie takes a lot of work and money. I didn't let myself dive into it too much because I don't want to work on something that'll never see the light of day. 


I have written about 12000 words of the oldest story. It is sort of my main project. Whenever I get sick of it, I'll work on another one. I try to stick to the ones that are closer to being finished, and also avoid any new ideas - even if they come, I jot them down quickly and come back to the ones that I have had the most progress with. 

I also managed to connect 4 of these stories with the main one. This way I can have prequels and spin offs instead of a bunch of random disconnected stories. 

Whenever I'm finding it hard to focus on one single story I just open all of these 4 stories simultaneously and jump from one to the other. That way I can take advantage of my short attention span to drift between different projects instead of just drifting in and out of working. It is certainly not the most straightforward way of doing it, but I find it is better than being stuck with all of these ideas and doing nothing. I try to write at least 1 line a day and this method helps do that for multiple stories.

I am certainly not the most efficient nor the quickest writer, so perhaps I'm not a great example, but hopefully after reading my comment you can at the very least know that it is possible to deal with ADHD and still write. 

I should mention, though, that I am not on any medication for ADHD. It can help you focus, so if you have that option, look for a doctor.",2022-11-22,none,0.049,0.076,0.9534,positive

I suffer from anxiety stuff, especially due to past broken up friendships/relationships which were on my mind constantly. I promise this is not a trauma dump.

The rest of the day is left to work, family and imagination. 

I write in Obsidian for my long term project and use Amplenote as my brain dump. I reckon I have hundreds of ideas in Amplenote, but I've just finished an intensive second structural draft on my novel. The first draft was just getting the story down. The third draft is scene and chapter writing intensively. 

Those initial ideas, although they feel great when you are brain dumping, are just the joy of creating. We all love that. But that doesn't make a great story for others. It just makes you feel good.

I found that my other ideas are just initial inspiration. Now, I have a rock tight, logical plot and characters as I learnt to channel my creativity into the intricate aspects of the one world, plot and characters. Use that inquisitive energy to develop backstory for characters, the intricacies of your world, dialogue and written style. The craft is rich and when channelled, ADHD is a godsend to the writer.

Reddit,"ADHD here. I use MS OneNote free online, where I keep track of all kinds of ideas in an organized fashion. I've been working on one main story and I can't help but to have other ideas so I write them down as they come, too. It was important for me to do this in a way that helped me to retain it all without losing motivation, which is easy for me when I'm overwhelmed and get lost. As Dr. Barkley calls it, *Intention* Deficit Disorder. OneNote is set up to represent physical binders so if you liked organizing your stuff at school with tabbed binders, you will love having infinite binders and tabs wherein you can link ideas straight to each other, copy and paste pictures from the web, and even insert charts from other files -- or the files themselves. 

Anything I'm learning can be kept as ""notes,"" which helps due to all the rabbit hole diving. I'll write something down that I saw in a YouTube video and make it a hyperlink then  keep watching, knowing that I didn't lose something valuable (the info, idea, or the video) and also that I can add to that note or organize it better later. I take pictures of books while I read them. I insert uploads of 3x5 cards. As you know, all this learning and creative activity spawns ideas all over the place and it's nice how over time I know where to put the idea(s), or at least where to find them if I might have had them before. In fact, over time the pattern of interests emerges quite cleanly in a way that is easily reorganizeable for your needs since you can move info around within a tab or tabs around within a binder or copy and paste it wholly to another binder. I work within three binders that I think only need to be two. It was four about a year ago I think. I started doing this writing last summer. 

And I'm 38, so it's not like I'm new to trying to find my stuff and things. I have used all kinds of tools in the past and have been burned when they are no longer supported. OneNote already works exactly the way you expect it to (it's not trying to be anything other than what it is or anything special to any niche people) and it's by Microsoft so it probably won't change or go anywhere. They do still collect feedback. I think a colleague recommended it to me in 2009 lol. 

I appreciate being able to dump my thoughts and feel like they are at least there if I ever want to reference them again just like neurotypical people talk about having a writer's notebook. I revisit my my old notes and ideas whenever I take new ones because I'm forced to stay organized (and I like that since it adds a measure of control so I feel sane the whole time I'm using it). The benefit here is that I might remember why I had started down another train of thought and finally make a link of ideas. Other times I'm embarrassed or bewildered that I was ever interested but hey. 

How this has worked out well for me recently is in something people say *not* to do, which is in choosing your theme/s. One of my story problems, though, was that I apparently wanted to say or had to say *too many things* (ADHD-typical) about one of the central story issues and really just needed to choose, cut, and otherwise best portray what the characters are doing and be able to state that clearly. Like most writers, I had too much going on. But I also couldn't tell the difference between a couple of core conflicts as I was working out how characters were getting from this scene to that. 

Without separately keeping track in OneNote as I was working on these ideas for myself, I think I would have been lost in something like rumination; I couldn't possibly have mulled over the same charged stuff for a year and found my way through and back without taking notes that separated my observations, lessons learned, and concerns to show me where one conflict started and ended. And what I think my best opinions are that shine through in some of my character's and world's choices. This more recent clarity helped me suddenly imagine what at least a few missing scenes could be (the answers for those were already there thanks to the copious research note-taking.) And feel a little better about a couple of cut ideas though one is still stinging as I picture it.

2. Get up.

3. Go outside.

4. Walk around the block.

I get the direct impression from these kids that they can't keep still. The idea they will EVER write a six-hundred page, perfectly paced, perfectly edited, Stephen King worthy type novel are FOREVER beyond their reach.

You still following me?

How many words is that?

See what I wrote as the maximum energy you might be able to exert in ONE sitting at the computer. (Keep in mind. That's your major problem, isn't it? Sitting still and writing, right?) Do you find you sleep in batches of say, five hours? How about figuring out what size your WRITING batch total might be?

250 words?

A thousand words? Two thousand? What seems to be that point at which, like the sprinter you currently are (yet one day, when you string all those sprints together, in total, you will REALIZE you are just as capable of being a LONG DISTANCE RUNNER--you're just not seeing that jumbled collection of sprints as one activity--and is IT, my friend, it IS) you run out of focus?

Capture that number. And write it down.

Repeat this process ten times and look at what you've done. (That INCLUDES going outside and going for a walk. I still believe that ADHD is more about having energy to burn so go outside and figuratively run around to burn off some of that energy. Sitting and fidgeting at a computer just isn't gonna do it. Isn't it funny that boys, supposedly, are more prone to ADHD yet more boys write novels? Hm.)

A book starts here. And ends there. There is no magic to this. Ask Stephen King.

Also: do you use Photo Booth (on a Mac?) Why not spill your rabid brain on film? Stop the camera when you wish to move to a new or unique thought. You mentioned being unable to keep up with your speeding thoughts?

Then don't. Turn on the Photo Booth camera and JUST talk.

Word Anvil is great for prepping and project tracking, it causes your work to be public, although I haven't seen the changes they made in recent years so they probably have a lot of cool stuff I don't know about and maybe have the option to private some of your work.

I think another technique to help learn to type faster, closer to the ""speed of thought"" is to type dictation. Watch a movie and type out every word as it comes. You don't have to come up with the words, but you train yourself to type at a faster speed. 

I bracket for \[TK - fix this obviously stupid name you git\] all the time. The brackets make the text stand out even more.

I have also started to wander in a scene and going back to ask ""what does this scene need to accomplish?"" helps me get back on focus.

As for the stalling bit, I've always found info dumping on something semi-related to the story (for reference, my original novel is set in late 19th century America, so fashion tends to be my go-to for that or something that fits the topic of where I'm at in the story) helps get me back on track.",2024-11-06,none,0.068,0.072,0.128,positive

Reddit,"Thanks for this. I truly don't have any hints or tips. I've done things differently each year and am not consistent with what works for me. In the years that I've won, I just kept going and didn't give up. In most of the years that I didn't, I just gave up and didn't try past the first few days. There were two years in which I gave it a real effort, but I just couldn't reach 50,000 words, although I haven't really figured out why. I got pretty close, though, and so I still count those as victories because I kept going, even when I felt like just giving up.

So, well, I guess my advice, for lack of a better word, is to just keep going. Even when you're not ""feeling it,"" just keep at it and keep going. Life can't be based on ""feeling it"" or not, and if a person is going to get things done, then a person just has to get on with it and do whatever it is they're doing instead of just giving up at the first sign of trouble or what have you, no matter how hard it seems to be. 

I recently discovered 4thewords and have been going there every single day since I signed up on 2 October. I even have a monthly subscription because I love it so much. It's gotten me writing at least 444 words every single day. Because of the way my life is, there's usually two or three days a week when I truly can't write more than that, but at least it's gotten me writing every day again. 🙂

In regards to music, unless it's playing super softly in the background and is just an instrumental piece and not an instrumental version of a song with words, I can't have anything on in the background while I write, unless it's nature sounds from outside my window.

I'd love to know how people write when songs with lyrics come on. I almost always end up typing or writing out the lyrics when I hear them. haha

Reddit,"Initial worldbuilding and outlining aren't strictly necessary if you're able to discovery write within a premise and just see where the story takes you. I prefer to write in this way -- I'll start out with some idea of what the story is like, jot it down, and wander around discovering characters and plot threads. After about ~20k words of this I have a better idea of where the story's headed and *then* I'll write up some kind of outline. Afterwards I'll work within that and make changes / revamp the outline and sort of go back and forth like that until the first draft is done.

I have the same approach with worldbuilding -- I need just enough to get the story started and then will figure out more as I go. Doing it this way tightly winds the worldbuilding around the plot because they're outlined/changed at the same time and heavily influence each other.",2025-02-06,none,0.0,0.049,0.7845,positive

You can create your own group, track progress with leader boards, run writing sprints, and help your students plan, write, and even edit their projects. It’s a great way to stay organized and keep your students motivated throughout NaNoWriMo (and beyond). I think it might work well for you and that you could set up a group just for your class and use the tracking tools to monitor each student's progress, similar to what you mentioned. 

I'm one of the co-founders of WritingHabit and it is still in beta, but many authors are already loving the web app. Most of the functionality is currently free as we get feedback from writers. Our goal is to fully launch in 2025, and we’ll always offer a free option because we believe in making writing accessible to everyone.

Reddit,"You've described symptoms of a problem, but not the actual problem, so it's hard to give advice here on how to break out of this pattern. 

If it's simply that you've bitten off more than you can chew yet with these projects, you need to lower your expectations of yourself. If you wanted to learn how to play a song on a piano, you wouldn't start with Moonlight Sonata, you would probably learn Mary Had a Little Lamb. In writing terms, this means starting with short stories, things you can put ""The End"" on in a short amount of time. Write a 300 word bedtime story for a kid with a beginning, middle, and end. Build up your writing muscles and get in the habit of finishing things. 

If your writing muscles can only handle ten minutes, then write for ten minutes a day. Writing is mental work, and 30 minutes of non-stop writing is a workout. Approach it like a fitness program and build up your writing time incrementally so you don't overload your brain and exhaust yourself. 

If there's something deeper psychologically, like ADHD or depression or lack of confidence to finish, you're going to have to work that out first and the writing will follow. Do you have a habit of not finishing things you start in general, or is it just with writing?

Reddit,"It's possible that you're putting too high an expectation on your first draft.

When we read a published story, we're reading a polished, edited, re-written work, that has been through possibly many drafts. It flows, it's engaging, and it's fun to read. 

We want to write a story like that, but the first draft will never come out like that. Many writers encounter that reality and stop writing, thinking that there must be something wrong, or that they are not a good enough writer.

The reality is that writing is a long slog. The sheer physical effort of putting words on paper, even if the story is mentally fully formed, can be intimidating.

My suggestion is to not put restraints on a process that is already difficult. Don't place any expectations on your first draft, just write it. Any problems with story, description, grammar, spelling...those are SECOND draft problems. 

I also suggest writing at least a rough outline, making a list of the story's highlights, so that you don't lose sight of them while drafting.",2023-07-31,none,0.136,0.049,-0.9652,negative

Reddit,"Maybe don't start too big? Nothing wrong with knocking out a few short stories, or even just a few scenes of a bigger whole that are in your head. Think of them as small projects and allow yourself to feel a sense of accomplishment for finishing them, even if they're only 500 words. Starting something that you know is going to be 70k+ words is a daunting task and something a lot of people struggle with. You don't have to do that right away; it's something you can work up to. 

It might also be a matter of genre. I really wanted to write romance stories because I enjoyed reading them so much but I'm just no good at it and found myself abandoning stories after a few chapters every time. Now I write much more action-packed stuff with some romantic side-plots and I'm much happier for it. I'm not sure it's any better in terms of quality but I'm at least managing to write more than a handful of chapters and enjoying myself while doing it. 

Or maybe, and this is absolutely not meant to discourage you, maybe writing isn't for you? If you do end up trying different things and you find you still don't really enjoy it... it might not be the thing you want to do, which is absolutely fine. Everybody enjoys different things. Absolutely try to find the joy in writing if that's what you want to do, but if you never find it that's not the end of the world. I'm sure there's other stuff you can put energy into that you do actually love doing.",2023-07-31,none,0.045,0.171,0.9899,positive
